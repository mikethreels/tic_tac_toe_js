        <h2>Hi players,</h2>
        <span>
          welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe, before you start the game let us explain the game-play a little.
          <ul>
            <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
            <li>you both get a symbol assigned, see the input box to see which one</li>
            <li>Players take turns putting their symbols in empty squares.</li>
            <li>The first player to get 3 of his/her symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
            <li>When all squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
          </ul>
          BEFORE YOU START:  please pick your name and symbol you would like to play with.
        </span>
